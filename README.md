# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Shopping-Mall-Management-System
An organised and systematic solution is essential for all shopping malls and supermarkets. There are many departments of administration for the maintenance of membership and product details. Most of these records need to maintain information about the number of years of membership to avail discount accordingly. The other general details of the members may include member name, ID, address and phone number. All the modules in shopping mall administration are interdependent. They are maintained manually. So they need to be automated and centralized as information from one module will be needed by other modules.
